/**
 * `PoolBoundSqlTag` — the pool-level extension of {@link SqlTag}
 * (ADR-0006). Adds scope-builder methods that only make sense at the
 * pool layer:
 *
 * - `.acquire()` — reserves a fresh connection from the pool (the
 *   `ReservedConn` adds nothing on top of the base {@link SqlTag}
 *   that justifies a nested `.acquire()` on a pinned scope).
 * - `.transaction()` — opens a server-side transaction on a freshly
 *   reserved connection, with the resolved isolation level.
 *
 * The base {@link SqlTag} (callable + `.unsafe`) is what's present on
 * every scope (pool-bound, ReservedConn, Transaction, Savepoint).
 *
 * Internal: the {@link Client} constructs one of these for its
 * `client.sql` and passes the pool's `acquire` function alongside the
 * underlying {@link RequestRunner} and the resolved client default
 * isolation level.
